                        <p>Front-end web development is the development of the graphical user interface of a website, through the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so that users can view and interact with that website.<br>
                            Everything you see on a website, like buttons, links, animations, and more, were created by a front end web developer. It is the front end developer's job to take the vision and design concept from the client and implement it through code.<br>
                            Everything on the page from the logo to the search bar, buttons, overall layout and how the user interacts with the page was created by a front end developer. Front end developers are in charge of the look and feel of the website.<br>
                            Front end developers also have to make sure the website looks good on all devices (phones, tablets, and computer screens).

                        <p>Back-end Development refers to the server-side development. It focuses on databases, scripting, website architecture. It contains behind-the-scene activities that occur when performing any action on a website. It can be an account login or making a purchase from an online store. Code written by back-end developers helps browsers to communicate with database information.<br>
                            Back-end development means working on server-side software, which focuses on everything you can't see on a website. Back-end developers ensure the website performs correctly, focusing on databases, back-end logic, application programming interface (APIs), architecture, and servers.<br>
                            Backend development refers to the process of creating and maintaining the server-side components of a web application or software.

                    <p>Full-stack development refers to the practice of building web applications or software systems that involve both front-end and back-end development.<br>
                        A full-stack developer is someone who has the knowledge and skills to work on both the client-side (front end) and server-side (back end) components of an application.<br>
                        a full-stack developer possesses a broad skill set, combining front-end development expertise with back-end development knowledge, database management, API integration, version control, and deployment skills.<br>
                        This allows them to work on all aspects of web application development, from the user interface to the server-side functionality, creating end-to-end solutions.
